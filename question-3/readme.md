# 3. Build a feature for Store's Inventory.

Suppose a store has a list of items and their prices in US Dollars stored as an object. Create a JavaScript program to convert the prices to Indian Rupees using an exchange rate of 1 USD to 80 INR. The program should use the map higher-order function to create a new object with the converted prices in Rupees.
